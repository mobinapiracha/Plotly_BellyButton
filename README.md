# Plotly: Belly Button Diversity 

### Website: https://mobinapiracha.github.io/Plotly_BellyButton/

## Overview 
In this project we will work for a plant-based meat startup Improbable beef to explore bellybutton biodiversity data to find a bacterial specie that synthesizes proteins that taste like beef. Therefore, we have sampled the navels of people across the country to identify bacterial species. Using the Plotly library in Javascript, we will use belly button biodiversity data to create data visualizations that research participants and researchers can access to see which bacterial species are present in the navel.

## Results
* Leveraged d3.select function to create dropdown menu for selecting each research participant’s ID and used d3.json to create a function that displays the demographic information for each respondent
* Created variables to hold sample’s IDs, labels and values, sorted these values in descending order using the feature and choose the top 10 bacterial cultures found to be displayed in our bar chart 
* Constructed a bubble plot to display the bacteria cultures for each sample and a gauge chart to display weekly washing frequency values 
* Tools: Javascript (D3, Plotly), HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
